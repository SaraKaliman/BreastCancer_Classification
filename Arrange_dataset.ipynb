    "# Preparing Kaggle ICD data set for DL training\n",

    "Data set is available under: https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/breast-histopathology-images\n",
    "Kaggle say that data set containes 1.5 GB of data but it needs more than 3 GB space on dics due to metadata. \n",
    "Images are stored in numerious directories named with a number preresenting the ID of a patient. \n",
    "Such a large data set can not fit into computer memory and during training we have to use a data generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data generator expects a path to directory where data is saved in subdirecotries named as the classes.\n",
    "Therefore, we must fistly create tran, validation and test subdirectories where data will be sotred in two directories (since we have binary classification problem).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a code that will create new directory where all the files will be copied in \n",
    "traning (72% of total data), validation (8% of data) and testing (20% of data) directories.\n",
    "Each directory will contain subdirectories named \"0\" for negative examples and \"1\" for positives.\n",
